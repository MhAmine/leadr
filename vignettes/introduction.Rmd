This vignette will show the basics of the `leadr` workflow. To see how `leadr` supports more advanced ensemble model building, check out my Ensembles [vignette](https://tmastny.github.io/leadr/articles/ensemble.html). 

`leadr` is designed to create one leaderboard per R project per dataset. Currently, the leaderboard works best placed at the project root, with any number of subdirectories to save the models.

## Getting Started

```{r}
library(purrr)
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
library(leadr)
```

Let's build some models. We can easily build a list of models using `purrr::map`.

```{r}
models <- map(
  rep("rf", 4),
  ~train(
    Species ~ .,
    data = iris
  )
)
```

We can also `purrr` the models into our leaderboard. This time we use `purrr::walk` to update the leaderboard while returning quietly. 

```{r}
walk(models, board)
board()
```

By default, `board` saves the models into a folder at the root of the project called `models_one` and returns a tibble that provides us with everything we want to know about the model. 

The tibble gives us the ranking and metric score, as well as lists like `tune`, `index`, and `seeds` that allow us to exactly recreate the model. 

## Groups

Of course, fitting four random forest models on the same dataset isn't very realistic. We'd like to fit a variety of models and compare the accuracy. Let's use the `index` column of the leaderboard to fit a new model on the same bootstrap resamples as the first model.

```{r}
first_id <- which(board()$id == 1)
control <- trainControl(index = board()$index[[first_id]])
model <- train(Species ~ ., data = iris, method = 'glmnet', trControl = control)
board(model)
```

`caret` has a nice set of functions to compare models trained on the same bootstrap or cross-validation index. To find these comparable models, we can filter on the `group` column and use `leadr::to_list()` to convert the filtered leaderboard to a list of models.

```{r}
group <- board() %>% 
  filter(group == 1) %>%
  to_list()
```

From there, we can compare models using the `resamples` family of `caret` functions:

```{r, fig.align='center'}
results <- resamples(group)
summary(results)

modelCor(results)
splom(results)
```

## Peaking

`leadr` also has tools to help you evaluate model ranking as the leaderboard gets big. Let's add a few more models:

```{r}
models <- map(
  rep("rf", 20),
  ~train(
    Species ~ .,
    data = iris
  )
)

walk(models, board)
board()
```

By default the `tibble` package prints at most 20 rows and only 10 rows for larger tibbles. With `leadr::peak`, we can peak at the ranking of the first model and those in the surrounding positions:

```{r}
board() %>%
  peak(1)
```

We also peak at the last model ran:

```{r}
board() %>%
  peak(at_last())
```

`leadr::peak` also takes a variable number of inputs. If we want to compare the last model to the first model, it will return the smallest tibble that contains both. If it is 20 rows or under, it will print the entire tibble.

```{r}
board() %>%
  peak(at_last(), 1)
```

Thanks to [pillar](https://github.com/r-lib/pillar) and [crayon](https://github.com/r-lib/crayon), `leadr::peak` also has special printing when used in a supported console. Here is an example of `peak` in the RStudio console. Notice that it highlights the peaked models in the console output.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("leadr_pic.png")
```
